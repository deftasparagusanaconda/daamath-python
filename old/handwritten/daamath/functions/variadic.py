# these are functions that are either naturally variadic, or come from associative operators
#
# it is not required that they are commutative. an example is concatenation. it is associative but not commutative :) interesting, right??
#
# if the primitive operator has an identity element, its minimum argument count is zero. otherwise, it must receive at least as much elements as the primitive requires.
